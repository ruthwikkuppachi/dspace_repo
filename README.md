# DSpace Personal Repository of Publicly Available Weather and Air Quality Datasets

This repository contains the files pertaining to my personal repository of publicly available datasets on weather on Kaggle, stored on DSpace.

As a data scientist, I regularly work with publicly available datasets on platforms like Kaggle. However, many of the datasets on Kaggle lack relevant metadata and it is hard for a user to immediately know what each dataset is about without downloading and exploring the dataset. Therefore, I wanted to use DSpace to create a mini-repository of these weather and air quality datasets from Kaggle and add metadata descriptions to these datasets for easier discoverability. There are two reasons why I wanted to work on this personal project:

- I wanted to explore the DSpace repository and its features.
- I regularly work with projects in the climate/weather field so having all these datasets in one place with relevant metadata would be helpful in case I needed to work on a project requiring a specific dataset. 

Through this project, I got to learn a lot about managing and administering a DSpace repository. I learned how to create Communities and Collections, add Items to each Community, and add relevant metadata fields to each Item.
